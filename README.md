## 1. Project Overview

This project focuses on **Data Wrangling** and **Data Visualization** using Python. The data comes from the ECE Board Exam dataset. The tasks involve analyzing the dataset, creating specific data frames, and visualizing how different features contribute to a student's average grade.

---

## 2. Intended Learning Outcomes

- Identify the necessary codes and functions for data cleaning and visualization.
- Apply Python programming to wrangle and visualize data.

---

## 3. Dataset

The dataset used for this project is available [here](https://bit.ly/ECEBoardExamDataset).

---

## 4. Key Tasks

### a. Data Wrangling

1. **Create the following data frames based on given conditions**:
    - **Instru**: Contains students with the "Instrumentation" track and from "Luzon," showing their name, GEAS, and Electronics scores greater than 70.
    - **Mindy**: Includes students from "Mindanao," in the "Female" gender category, showing their name, track, and average scores greater than or equal to 55.

### b. Data Visualization

2. **Analyze the data to visualize how various features (e.g., chosen track, gender, hometown) contribute to the average grade**. Key insights involve understanding the impact of these features on a student's performance.

## 5. Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the dataset from the provided link.
3. Open the `Ninobla_PA-4.ipynb` Jupyter notebook file.
4. Install required libraries by running the following in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Run the cells in the notebook sequentially to reproduce the results, which include:
    - Data Wrangling to create specific data frames.
    - Visualizations that explore the relationships between variables and the average score.

## 6. Dependencies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.

## 7. Results and Insights

The project reveals key insights about how:
- The chosen track (e.g., Instrumentation, Communication) affects a student's performance.
- Gender and hometown play roles in determining academic success in specific categories.
